# sample-Recipe-app-demo
This is an ordinary Node.js app. This app shows ideas for different recipes and helps encourage your cooking knowledge. The app will be made up of divided add, view, and update buttons, which allow you to learn more about the information.
 With the help of add, we can add recipes for different dishes, and for that, you should add your name, the main ingredient of your recipe, and how much time it will take to cook this meal. At the end, you should leave your phone number. The update helps to change some parts of the recipe, and with the help of divide, we can remove recipes that are not necessary for us. 
 To create this app, we used different coding technologies as a frontend, which include HTML, CSS, and PUG. The second technique is backend, which also includes parts such as node.js, express.js, and dataset mock_db.json.
